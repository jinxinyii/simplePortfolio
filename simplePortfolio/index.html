                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you. My name is Elmar, 
                    and I'm currently a college student pursuing BSIT at STI College Rosario.<br><br>
        
                    While my academic focus lies in BSIT, my interests extend far beyond the classroom. 
                    I'm an avid reader, a passionate explorer of diverse cultures, and a firm believer in the power of 
                    continuous learning. Whether it's delving into the pages of a novel, engaging in thought-provoking 
                    discussions, or seeking out new experiences, I thrive on the exchange of ideas and the pursuit of 
                    knowledge.

                <p>
                    This project is a culmination of my efforts as a student to pursue my College Degree. 
                    As a 3rd Year College student in STI Rosario, I embarked on this journey to discover on what should 
                    I improve more and enhaned my basic knowledge about programming.<br><br>
